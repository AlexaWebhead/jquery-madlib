He had a different <span class=\"output4\">suit</span> for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, \"he is sitting in council,\" it was always said of him, \"The Emperor is sitting in his <span class=\"output5\">wardrobe</span>.\"\n                    <br />\n                    Time passed merrily in the large <span class=\"output6\">town</span> which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court.

Then bells sounded in the large white building on the cliff, and a number of young <span class=\"output3\">girl</span>s came into the garden. The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high <span class=\"output4\">rocks</span> that rose out of the water; then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen, and watched to see what would become of poor <span class=\"output2\">prince</span>. She did not wait long before she saw one of the young <span class=\"output3\">girl</span>s approach the spot where they lay. The <span class=\"output3\">girl</span> seemed <span class=\"output5\">frightened</span> at first, but only for a moment; then the <span class=\"output3\"></span> fetched a number of people, and the mermaid saw that <span class=\"output2\">prince</span> came to life again, and <span class=\"output6\">smiled upon</span> those who stood around. But <span class=\"output2\"></span> knew not that she was the real savior. This made her very <span class=\"output7\">unhappy</span>, and when <span class=\"output2\"></span> was led away into the great building, she dived down <span class=\"output8\">sorrowfully</span> into the water, and returned to her father's <span class=\"output9\">castle</span>. She had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she was more so than ever. Her sisters asked her what she <span class=\"output10\">had seen</span> during her first visit to the surface of the water; but she would tell them nothing.
