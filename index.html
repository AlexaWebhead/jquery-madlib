It was a <span class="output4"></span> creature, with slender legs, bright, intelligent eyes, and a <span class="output5"></span> that hung down over his neck like a veil. He had carried his master through <span class="output6"></span> and <span class="output7"></span> in the battle-field, with the <span class="output8"></span> whistling round him; he had kicked and bitten, and taken part in the fight, when the enemy advanced; and, with his master on his <span class="output9"></span>, he had dashed over the fallen foe, and saved the golden <span class="output10"></span> and the Emperor's life, which was of more value than the brightest gold. This is the reason for the Emperor's <span class="output1"></span> wearing golden <span class="output2"></span>s. </p>

                    <p class="game-output">Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively <span class="output1">fond</span> of new <span class="output2">clothes</span>, that he spent all his money on them. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to <span class="output3">theater</span> or hunt, except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new <span class="output2">clothes</span>. He had a different <span class="output4">suit</span> for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of him, "The Emperor is sitting in his <span class="output5">wardrobe</span>."
                    <br />
                    Time passed merrily in the large <span class="output6">town</span> which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two <span class="output7">rogues</span>, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to <span class="output8">weave</span> stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the <span class="output2">clothes</span> manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining <span class="output9">invisible</span> to everyone who was <span class="output10">unfit</span> for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.</p>

Then bells sounded in the large white building on the cliff, and a number of young <span class="output3">girl</span>s came into the garden. The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high <span class="output4">rocks</span> that rose out of the water; then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen, and watched to see what would become of poor <span class="output2">prince</span>. She did not wait long before she saw one of the young <span class="output3">girl</span>s approach the spot where they lay. The <span class="output3">girl</span> seemed <span class="output5">frightened</span> at first, but only for a moment; then the <span class="output3"></span> fetched a number of people, and the mermaid saw that <span class="output2">prince</span> came to life again, and <span class="output6">smiled upon</span> those who stood around. But <span class="output2"></span> knew not that she was the real savior. This made her very <span class="output7">unhappy</span>, and when <span class="output2"></span> was led away into the great building, she dived down <span class="output8">sorrowfully</span> into the water, and returned to her father's <span class="output9">castle</span>. She had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she was more so than ever. Her sisters asked her what she <span class="output10">had seen</span> during her first visit to the surface of the water; but she would tell them nothing. Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left <span class="output2"></span></p>
